    <p class="about_para">Book Bear started as a small dream, held by two young
        entrepreneurs in Portland, Oregon. These ladies wanted
        to create a fun and new book site for everyone, 
        filled with affordable and amazing authors. </br>
    </br>
        With this shared goal, we set out to begin. Once a 
        modest website, we have now grown by leaps and bounds
        into the amazing business you see now! </br>
</br>
        Feel free to explore, our creation speaks for itself!
